# **Time Series Models**

This repository contains a collection of time series analysis and forecasting projects, implemented in Python using libraries such as **pandas**, **NumPy**, **statsmodels**, and **Matplotlib**.

## Projects (Models)
- **Autoregressive Models (AR, MA, ARMA)** – capturing short-term dependencies in time series.  
- **ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX** – modeling and forecasting non-stationary series with trend and seasonality.  
- **Vector Autoregression (VAR)** – analyzing and forecasting multiple interdependent time series.  
- **ARCH & GARCH** – modeling time-varying volatility, commonly applied in finance and econometrics.  

## Techniques & Statistical Tests
- **Stationarity Testing** – Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for detecting unit roots and verifying stationarity.  
- **Heteroscedasticity Testing** – Breusch-Pagan and White tests to detect changing variance in residuals.  
- **Normality & Autocorrelation Checks** – Shapiro-Wilk, Jarque-Bera, and Ljung-Box test to validate residual behavior.  
- **Autocorrelation Analysis** – ACF (Autocorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function) plots for model identification and residual diagnostics.  
- **Parameter Significance** – Z-statistics and p-values for evaluating model coefficients.  
- **Model Selection & Diagnostics** – comparing models using AIC, BIC, and residual analysis to ensure robustness.  
- **Rolling Forecast & Backtesting** – evaluating forecast stability over time with out-of-sample predictions.  
- **Forecast Evaluation Metrics** – RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and Theil’s U-statistic to assess accuracy.  
- **Data Preprocessing** – differencing, scaling, and seasonal decomposition to prepare data for modeling.
